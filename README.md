## **Application Overview** <a name="application-overview"></a>

My Top Favorite is a social media platform where registered users can create, edit and share lists containing a rank of their favorite things of a certain theme. Along with each list item, the user has the option to attach a personalized text talking about the chosen item. Users can also follow other users to keep up with their listings.

The platform is integrated with external APIs, therefore, when creating a list, the user can search for items belonging to that theme in reliable sources. As an example, a user creating a list of his favorite action movies will be able to search for them in the collection of the Tmdb platform.

Currently the platform supports lists with themes related to movies, series and public personalities.The theme possibilities are endless and new themes will be supported soon!

## **Front End Description** <a name="front-end-description"></a>

The platform implementation is split into two repositories. This repository contains the React front end and [this repository](https://github.com/AmandaFI/MyTopFavorite-Web-Application-Backend.git) contains the API implemented using Ruby on Rails.

The user interface was implemented using the front end library React and the TypeScript programming language. The libraries Material UI and Material Icons were used for styling the interface components and the Vite tool was used to run and build the project.

The axios promise-based HTTP Client was used to consume the [implemented Rails API](https://github.com/AmandaFI/MyTopFavorite-Web-Application-Backend.git). As mentioned in the [overview section](application-overview) the platform interacts with external APIs and currently all data ranked in the lists is fetched from the [Tmdb API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) using axios. In the future other external APIs will be added to the platform.

The pages routing was built using the React Router DOM package and React Tostify package was used to display friendly messages to the user.

Some application pages have the drag and drop feature amoung its components. The React DnD package is commonly used to implement this kind of feature, however, until the date of implementation of this project, this package presents issues related to the Strict Mode tool in React version 18.x that affects its operation. Therefore the @hello-pangea/dnd package was used to implement this feature.

There are 6 pages in the interface:

- Sign Up: area for new users registration.
- Sign In: area where the user can log in to the platform.
- Feed: page where the user can see and interact with the lists shared by the users he follows and search for other users profiles.
- User private area: page where the user can manage his published and drafted lists.
- Edit list area: page where the user can create and edit lists.
- User public profile: page where public information and lists of a searched user are displayed and where one user can follow/unfollow another user.
